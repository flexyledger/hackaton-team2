# Manila Public Transit Optimization
Manila Public Transit Optimization

This project aims to improve public transportation in Manila using blockchain technology.

# 💫 Design Motto
"Using Blockchain to Improve Public Transportation in Manila"

# 🔭 Design Concept
Public transit accounts for most trips in Manila but faces issues like traffic congestion, inefficient routing, and lack of rider incentives. Blockchain solutions can transform the system.

## 📊 Problems

* Traffic Congestion: Private vehicles contribute disproportionately.
* Inefficient Routing: Major roads get clogged while alternatives go unused.
* Lack of Rider Incentives: No systems to encourage sustainable options.

## ✍️  Solutions

* Decentralized Ride Sharing via blockchain coordination.
* Dynamic Traffic Routing to optimize real-time vehicle flow.
* Rewards Programs to incentivize public transit usage.
* Public Utility Vehicle optimization through designated stops.
  
## 🏆 Benefits
* Reduced congestion and optimized transportation
* Cost and time savings for commuters and drivers
* Environmental benefits
* Support and rewards for sustainable options
* Improved earnings for drivers
* Rider empowerment through decentralization
  
# 💻 Tech Stack
* Ethereum for creation of rewards tokens
* Solidity for smart contract development
* Javascript for web/mobile apps
* IPFS for decentralized storage

##### This blockchain solution empowers Manila to finally overcome its public transit challenges.
